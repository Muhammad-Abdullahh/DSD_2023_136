# Digital System Design Lab
In this lab we are going to work on practical implementations of digital logic circuits and learn how to design, simulate, and test digital systems. The experiments typically involve logic gates, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, and hardware description languages (HDL) and for this lab we use system verilog.
