# LAB 5
## Overview

In this lab we designed a controller circuit for 7-segment displays on FPGA .We controlled which one of the hexadecimal character to display and on which of 8 7-segment display of FPGA to display it on.We also designed this circuit using behavioral model of decoders .Two decoders were used one for cathode and other one for anode.
